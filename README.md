# Advent of Code 2017
It's my answers for the [Advent of Code (2017)](http://adventofcode.com/2017)! This year's excuses for my inevitable position at the bottom of the leaderboards are programming in [Rust](rust-lang.org), an excellent language with which I have zero skill, and using an ergonomic keyboard that moves all of the symbol and function keys. Lets do this :D

## Running
Modify `main.rs` to point to whichever day + puzzle you're looking for, install Rust, then execute `cargo run`.
